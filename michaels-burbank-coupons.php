Make sure you click Allow or Grant Permissions if your browser asks for your location. You can also search near a city, place, or address instead. Went there last night because their website says they had a few of this one item in stock. This store is terrible. The shelves are only about half-stocked, making it really hard to find all but the most common craft supplies. They put <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> ads online that make it look like all of their frames are on sale. You get to the store and they <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/coupons-michaels-canada.php">coupons michaels canada</a> signs up that make it seem <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> any frames made by "Studio Decor" their sub-par quality frame "company" are on sale. Then you get to the register and whatever frame you brought up there just happens to not be the one on sale. The staff here is almost as sub-par as the quality of their frames. Everyone at Hobby Lobby seems happy to help! Especially since the parking lot at the <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-joanns-coupons.php">Michaels joanns coupons</a> Center is such a nightmare to boot!!!! Popped in to get a picture <b>michaels burbank coupons.</b> But I had trouble finding the size I needed. So I waited to speak with the custom frames desk in the back. One guy had no idea how to help me so I had to wait for the lady who was speaking with others. Then she had <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> idea how to help me. So I just <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-coupons-custom-framing.php">michaels coupons custom framing</a> up picking something cheap around the right size out and bought that. It was the wrong size and I had to return it anyways. But they do have everything artsy you could dream of! It would be nice especially with the holiday season being here to have more employees who are enthusiastic and motivated to help customers and move the lines faster. This is why I go to Hobby Lobby now. First time in here in like months. <strong>Michaels burbank coupons</strong> saw several things I liked none of which had price tags. Or if it was half off all beads. Ughhhh I see why this location just has a 3-star rating and why Aaron Brothers and Hobby Lobby have higher ratings. I hardly come here but when I do it is always packed and the line to check <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-clifton-nj-coupons.php">michaels clifton nj coupons</a> is long. This is a popular store for crafters. The shelves are labeled unlike another craft store in town, Hobby Lobby. Parking is fine in the Empire Center. The reason for the two stars is because I really have had <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> at other Michaels stores and across the Empire Center <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-joanns-coupons.php">michaels joanns coupons</a> lot at Aaron Brothers. They have frames and framing materials in the back by their custom framing section, but you have to ask for assistance to see the mat boards, which are in their back room. The lady at the custom framing counter let us into the back to view the mat boards, but she appeared in such a rushed mood that we hurried up to pick a color so we could stop bothering her by wanting to see them. She kept tapping her fingers on something rather hard and quickly the entire time, sending us a clear message to grab a color and go. We asked why they were in the back room and she said they would get destroyed if they were out in the front. At first I thought, great, they will be cleaner <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-text-coupons.php">michaels text coupons</a> less beat up in the back. Big upon inspecting them, we realized they were mostly bad! So I just pointed to a couple of decent looking ones and told her I wanted those. She carried them to the counter and then realized one had a huge cut about 25" long <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> it. I never even touched the board. Go to Hobby Lobby for mat boards. They are cleaner, easier <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/does-joanns-take-michaels-coupons.php">does joanns take michaels coupons</a> get to, and less than half the price of the mat boards at <b>Michaels burbank coupons</b> I rarely go to this Burbank location, and I definitely do not plan on returning. The cashier Stephanie was very reluctant to assist me or my cousin. She was clearly not trained on customer service. This is a fairly big location but luckily, I ran into a worker almost <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-coupons-online-code.php">michaels coupons online code</a> after entering. She gave me the exact isle for what I was looking for. Grabbed the products and checked <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> in almost no-time. Overall, not a bad experience. I absolutely love this location! I always find what I need and they seem to always have everything on sale: Stopped by for jewlery supplies and found exactly what I needed, and of course on sale! I have been having the most miserable time with the framing department. I have spoken with so many staff members and no one can give me an answer. I have sat on hold for extended periods of time without being helped and I have had <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> call multiple days over the last <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> weeks to see what is happening. It is a wedding gift for someone who lives in Europe and at this rate they <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> be leaving without their gift. It has been the most frustrating experience and it is not worth the discount pricing. Paying a different company more money is definitely worth it to not have to go through this saga. They get two stars because I have never had a problem with the rest of the store and I always engage <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> really helpful and polite staff. The framing department deserves no stars. So unhappy. This <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> is for the custom framing department, with which I have had the good fortune of working for several years. Always gracious and patient, Maribel in <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> custom framing department has been a wonderful source of help with her creative ideas and suggestions, and Ivonne, the thoughtful dept. Before coming here, I always call first to be sure these ladies are available, and I appreciate the time and energy they devote to my framing orders. I went to Michaels on N Victory Place in Burbank to order custom frames for over thirty of my paintings. I was at first reluctant to arrive with such a huge order, and was concerned about the quality of service, patience, and attention that would be given to such a large order. When I arrived at the custom framing <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-issaquah-coupons.php">michaels issaquah coupons,</a> I was greeted and welcomed very kindly by Ivonne, who was soft-spoken and very courteous. I began with the selection of a frame for the first painting. Ivonne gave very insightful advice and <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> artistic taste while carefully selecting the most suitable and affordable frame. I have now chosen frames for all the paintings, and have spent a few thousand dollars very happily and satisfied with all the choices. Ivonne remained extremely <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> and discerning in finding the most appropriate frame for each one of my art works. Her courtesy and eagerness to help <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> grew with each frame she helped to select. I feel I have gained a real friend at Michaels. The five star rating I am granting her does not do her enough justice. She is not only gifted with artistic taste, but also genuinely committed to providing the highest quality of service to the customers at Michaels. They did their best to find what I was looking for. Great staff, well organized store. They have pretty much anything you might need for your artistic project, all sorts of painting accessories, all kinds of papers, frames, knitting and crochet, candles, ribbons, even if you are into making sculptures they got you covered. They also have really neat party supplies. Came here on <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/can-you-use-joann-coupons-at-michaels.php">can you use joann coupons at michaels</a> sunday afternoon and this place was packed, check-out took a while, but nothing unreasonable. The location is also good, since there are a bunch of other cool stores next door, <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> Best Buy, Target, Marshalls, Staples, even an Walmart. The buying experience was harrowing. This place was packed and the line to buy stuff was super long. I wash pushing a side by side, 28" wide double stroller and no one budged an inch when I was making my way up the aisles to the gingerbread house section. These crafty women and men are obsessed with their little projects so much so they forget basic manners. Oh, as for <strong>michaels burbank coupons</strong> gingerbread making class: Until it was time to leave. Then no one wanted to get out of the way so we could get out. If <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> kids wanted our spots, they <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> have at least moved out of the way. What is it with this place?! I ended up signing up for a free membership that would have coupons sent to my email as well as special discounts. The Service: Not a super busy store. Usually cashiers on duty, no long wait at check-out <strong>michaels burbank coupons.</strong> Staffs are friendly and helpful. The Parking: Parking lot sharing with other retailers. There are always parking spots in front of Michaels. The more I come here the more I regret it. So my advice is, if you see one in the parking lot, grab it. It really seems like they keep adding more and more crap, and the aisles are getting narrower and narrower. I hate the <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/does-michaels-accept-joann-coupons.php">does michaels accept joann coupons</a> layout. Inevitably I end up back tracking somewhere because I missed the one aisle I needed to find. I visited after thanksgiving so the store was pretty picked through, But there were some good deals. Ultimately I did not find what I was looking for and continued my search for the <b>michaels burbank coupons</b> <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-tires-plus-coupons.php">michaels tires plus coupons.</a> I do like that they re organized the cashiers. You are funneled through a bunch of low cost last minute crap. And the parking is way easier. Not my favorite, But I <a href="https://couponkraze.herokuapp.com/michaels-annapolis-coupons.php">michaels annapolis coupons</a> find myself in this store a few times a year. Best of luck!
